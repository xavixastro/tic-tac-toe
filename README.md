# tic-tac-toe

Let's write a Tic-Tac-Toe game! Read the entire instructions before getting started. You'll be creating this entire project from scratch, no skeleton. We'll build three iterations of the game, each adding an interesting twist on the gameplay:

Version 1 - Basic 3x3 grid game with 2 human players
Version 2 - Dynamic sized grid with 2 or more human players
Version 3 - Dynamic sized grid with 2 or more human or computer players
